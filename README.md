# PSUbox
PSUbox is an open source sandbox game currently in development!
This code utilizes Unity Game Engine
Some snippets from https://www.youtube.com/@comp3interactive
very amazing youtuber, go check him out! He explains how everything works as he
codes his stuff. Very good source if you are beginning game development as I am. 
Please note that not every bit of code is ripped straight from a youtube video. 
Although I am new to programming C#, I still code my own stuff. 
Big shout out to the Tech Titans discord server for posting some amazing E-books
and resources! https://discord.gg/pyqnuh9YEz They helped me out a lot! If you are
new to programming I recommend joining Tech Titans for very good resources for
almost any programming language. I also recommend comp3interactive youtube channel.
As stated previously, he explains everything he programs; I learn stuff from him,
I don't just mindlessly copy his code without understanding what it does.

Thank you for reading this
I hope you are looking forward to the following development progress
for my open source sandbox game, PseudoBox!

Thank you for the support!
